```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Getting Started

This code chunk performs three tasks:

- create a list of R packages needed.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
packages <- c('sf','tidyverse')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p,character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only =  T)
}

```
