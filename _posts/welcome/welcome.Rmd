Hi there! I'm Yiling. 

This blog is created for IS415 Geospatial Analytics & Application (SMU-X), a module in Singapore Management University (SMU) with the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong.

It stores the in-class exercises and take-home assignments I did for this module, all about doing Geospatial Analysis using R.

Besides this blog, my team did a geospatial analytics project on Point Pattern Analysis. Please feel free to have a look at it [here](https://spatial-pointers.netlify.app/)~ :D
